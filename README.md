## About
In this challenge, I created and manipulated Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data. I assumed the fictitious position of a new Chief Data Scientist for a city's school district. In this capacity, I will be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. As a first task, I have been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I will be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. It is my task to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

## Getting Started
To run this challenge on your computer, please download the PyCitySchools folder and open the PyCitySchools.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

## Summary
In this challenge, I analyzed different schools in a district regarding their performance, size, budget, and school types. I noticed that the data shows that even though larger district schools had a higher budget, scored in the lower percentile. On the other hand, the larger charter schools with medium budgets had higher overall test scores. Overall, the data shows that medium-sized schools, charter schools, and lower budgets have scored the highest overall test scores.
